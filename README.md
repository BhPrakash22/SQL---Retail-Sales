# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Level**: Beginner  
**Database**: `Sql_project_1`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `Sql_project_1`.


### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
select * from RetailSales
where age is Null 
	or
	category is null
	or
	quantiy is null
	or
	price_per_unit is null
	or
	cogs is null
	or
	total_sale is null;

Delete from retailsales
where age is Null 
	or
	category is null
	or
	quantiy is null
	or
	price_per_unit is null
	or
	cogs is null
	or
	total_sale is null;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
select * from  RS
WHERE CAST(sale_date AS DATE) = '2022-11-05';;
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM RetailSales
WHERE 
    category = 'clothing'
    AND 
    sale_date >= '2022-11-01' 
    AND 
    sale_date < '2022-12-01'
    AND 
    quantiy >= 4;
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
select category, 
	sum(total_sale) as net_sale,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
from RetailSales
group by category;
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT category, 
       AVG(age) AS average_age
FROM RetailSales
WHERE category = 'beauty'
GROUP BY category;

```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
select *
from retailsales
where total_sale > 1000;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
select  category,
	gender,
	count (*) as total_transactions 
from retailsales
group by category, gender;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
select YEAR, MONTH, average_sale
from	
	(
	select YEAR (sale_date) as year,
		MONTH (sale_date) as month,
		Avg (total_sale) as average_sale,
		RANK () over (partition by YEAR (sale_date) order by Avg (total_sale) Desc) as rank
	from RetailSales
	group by sale_date
	) as t1
where rank = 1;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
select top 5
	customer_id,
	sum (total_sale) as total_sales
from RetailSales
group by customer_id
order by total_sales desc;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
select category,
	count (distinct customer_id) as unique_customers
from RetailSales
group by category;
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
with hourly_sale
as
(
select *,
	case
		when DATEPART (hour, sale_time) < 12 then 'morning'
		when DATEPART (hour, sale_time) between 12 and 17 then 'afternoon'
		else 'evening'
	end as shift
from retailsales
) 
select shift,
	count (*) as total_sales
from hourly_sale
group by shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
